# To plot an image of a 10 by 10 grid and then apply a transformation to rotate the grid by 10 degrees, you can use the matplotlib and scipy libraries in Python. Here's how you can do it:

# Create a 10 by 10 grid using matplotlib.
# Apply a rotation transformation using scipy.ndimage.rotate.
# Plot the original and rotated grid.
# First, ensure you have matplotlib and scipy installed:

# Here's the Python code:
# pip install matplotlib scipy


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.ndimage import rotate

# Create a 10x10 grid
grid = np.zeros((10, 10))
grid[1::2, :] = 1  # Fill alternate rows to make the grid visible
grid[:, 1::2] += 1  # Fill alternate columns to make the grid visible
grid[grid == 2] = 1  # Ensure the grid is binary

# Plot the original grid
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  # 1 row, 2 columns, 1st subplot
plt.imshow(grid, cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
plt.title('Original Grid')

# Rotate the grid by 10 degrees
rotated_grid = rotate(grid, 10, reshape=True, mode='nearest')

# Plot the rotated grid
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  # 1 row, 2 columns, 2nd subplot
plt.imshow(rotated_grid, cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
plt.title('Rotated Grid 10 Degrees')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# This code does the following:

# Creates a 10 by 10 grid with alternating filled rows and columns to make the grid visible.
# Plots the original grid.
# Uses scipy.ndimage.rotate to rotate the grid by 10 degrees. The reshape=True parameter allows the output shape to change to accommodate the full rotated grid, and mode='nearest' is used to handle how the input array is extended beyond its boundaries.
# Plots the rotated grid next to the original for comparison.
